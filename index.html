<h2 style="text-align:center"> Career history: 
  </h2>
  <b>
I started working for Amazon in 2017 when I was only 19 years old, 
initially as a forklift driver. In 2019, I applied for the Transportation 
Operations Management team and was hired after the interview. I obtained my 
Commercial Driver's License and continued in that position for three years. 
Then, I applied for a Training Coordinator role within the same department in 
2022 and got hired after the interview, remaining on the team since then. I 
have developed a significant interest in the tech industry and now aspire to 
transition my career into this field, preferably with Amazon. To achieve this 
goal, I have enrolled in the Correlation One Software Development program through 
career choice and am thoroughly enjoying it. Additionally, I undertake various 
self-paced online courses to enhance my knowledge beyond the program. Ultimately, 
my aim is to become a full-stack developer.
